# OpNet
 
## Project Goal

**Challenges our model addresses:**
• It is difficult to identify small blood vessels and nerves during surgery due to limited contrast in color, shape, size, and dense networks.
• Errors and complications that come from surgical procedures increase hospital and health care costs and can result in adverse events.

**Objective:**
• Develop an object segmentation algorithm to automatically identify challenging anatomical structures to facilitate surgeons.

## Solution
We developed OpNet, a convolutional neural network trained on images mined from YouTube to identify the borders of blood vessels and nerves.

**Deliverables:**
• We presented this solution in the Sling Health Incubator 2021 Demo Day and provide the code in GitHub
